			<h1>IMPULSE</h1>
			<p>Impulse is a game where you can challenge yourself with different games(mostly IQ). The games include, connect the dots, memorize the pattern, 
			   grammar test, fill in the mathematical equation, or my personal favorite, 
			   candy sort. It's basically unshuffling beakers with different colours then placing them into another beaker with those same colours that 
			   you have transferred. Basically saying blue goes with blue and red goes with red. </p>
